# Udacity Image Classification Project

1. Introduction

The second project in a series of Deep Learning foundation's projects at Udacity, in which an image classification is built to classify images from the CIFAR-10( https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)  dataset. This dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.

2. Objective

 Normalize the images and the labels.
 Preprocess the images with one-hot encode.
 Build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
 Observe the neural network's predictions on the sample images.
 
In this project we Classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a convolutional neural network built with tensorflow. My accuracy is around 70% with 50 epochs.
